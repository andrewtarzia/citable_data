cage_library directory:
    * contains the structures from xTB optimisation as "_opt.mol"
    
complex_library directory:
    * contains the optimised structures of both complexes


ligand_library directory:
    * contains the input and output structures of XTB optimisations of Pd24L48 cages.
    * cleaned.xyz : initial structures, cleaned from provided .pdb files
    * opt.xyz : optimised structures


xray_structures directory:
    * analysis directory:
        * contains input .pdb files for xray structure (as single molecules) used in analysis
        * contains `all_xray_csv_data.csv`, which has all data needed on xray structures.
