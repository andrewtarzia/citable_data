Each .out file is generated from zeo_runs_production.py, which includes the output from Zeo++ for the probe radius and sampling value in the file name.

zeo_runs.py tests sampling values to check for convergence, those output files are not included here.

Each python script includes the list of CIFs to run the analysis on. Only the CIFs shown in the manuscript are included here, as testing was done on a series to see the effect of symmetry, disorder and cell size.
