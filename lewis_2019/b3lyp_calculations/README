- use SAS - optimise the structure, then reoptimise for 4_D with same input as the rest for consistency
- long optimisations were restarted using:
	geom=(checkpoint,step=X) if X < latest step
	calcfc and rcfc to calc and read force constants, respectively at the start of an optimisation from a checkpoint geometry.

- frequencies were run with 'freq'
