# citable_data
Input scripts and data required to reproduce some of my work.

Each folder contains it's own README containing information of the contents.

There is also a new `NAME_meta.json` for each file, automatically generated by the `meta_filler.py` script.
This contains information on all structure files, input_files, output_files, data_files.
